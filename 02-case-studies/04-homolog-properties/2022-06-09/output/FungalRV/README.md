the results here are generated by running the following command while in `../../script/FungalRV_adhesin_predictor` folder
`sh run-fungalrv-wrapper.sh ../../data/expanded-blast-homologs-edited-forFRV.faa ../../output/FungalRV`

Note that I had to manually edit the fasta file to 1) change an ambiguous code in XP_717775.2_Candida_albicans from B (Asx) to D (Asp) and 2) remove the "X" symbols from two sequences. See `../../data/README.txt` for details. This allowed FungalRV to run properly. But the results for those three sequences should be flagged.
