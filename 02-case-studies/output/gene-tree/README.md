Gene geneaology analysis for the XP_028889033 protein family. The subfolders correspond to different iterations of the analysis.
- `20200626-mega-lfs`: this is the earliest analysis that is largely based on Lindsey's course project from 2019 Bioinformatics
- `20200629-raxml-hb`: this is Bin's first attempt to use RAxML to construct a gene tree. The sequences were from Lindsey's alignment
- `20200706-raxml-hb`: this and the next folder contain results using the expanded list of homologs Bin assembled. the difference between the two is that the 20200706 folder is based on the alignment of the first 500 amino acids, while the `20200707` folder further extracts the first 500 columns of that alignment (to remove poorly aligned columns). The results are expected to be rather similar.
- `20200707-raxml-hb`: see above.
