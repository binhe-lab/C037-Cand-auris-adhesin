**Some general notes**

- Chain: according to [PDB101](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/dealing-with-coordinates)
    > Biological molecules are hierarchical, building from atoms to residues to chains to assemblies. Coordinate files contain ways to organize and specify molecules at all of these levels. As described above, the atom names and residue information are included in each atom record.
