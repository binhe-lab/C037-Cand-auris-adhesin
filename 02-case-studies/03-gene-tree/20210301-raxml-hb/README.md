# Goal
A repeat of the 2021-01-31 analysis (see sister folder) on an updated version of the homologs sequence. The difference between this and the 20210131 analysis is the addition of B9J08_004098, which _was_ included in earlier versions but removed in the previous two analyses in order to keep the _C. auris_ sequences in the homolog list all from one strain (B11221). However, further analysis revealed that the blastp against the refseq_prot database, which has B11221 as the representative for _C. auris_, apparently misses one sequence, as shown in Mu√±oz 2021 Genetics paper. I further found that one of the _C auris_ sequences recovered by the FungiDB blast (all from B8441) doesn't have a match among the B11221 hits from refseq, and almost surely is the ortholog of the missing B11221 sequence. Therefore I addded it back to the list, using it as a "replacement" for that missing sequence. See `blast/blast.nb.html` for details.

# Notes

To align the sequences, I first did the ClustalO alignment with 50 iterations, which took only a few minutes on 30 slots on ARGON. Instead of running Muscle on the unaligned sequences, I decided to use the `muscle -in <Aligned> -out <Refined> -refine` function as follows:

```bash
muscle -in XP_028889033_homologs_N500_clustalo.faa -out ./XP_028889033_homologs_N500_muscle_refined.faa -refine
```

Note that the above is now part of the `clustalo-align.sh` script. So it's no longer necessary to run it manually.

To extract the first 480 columns in the alignment for tree reconstruction, I used the following commands (now part of the `raxml-muscle.sh`)

```bash
bioawk -c fastx '{print ">"$name;print substr($seq, 1, 480)}' XP_028889033_homologs_N500_muscle_refined.faa > XP_028889033_muscle_refined_C480.faa
```

Lastly I used Notung 2.9 to reconcile the resulting gene tree (used `RAxML_bipartitions.muscle_100381`) with the species tree (`../../../data/20200724-species-tree.nwk`). Rooting analysis was performed in Notung, which scored the the Saccharomycetaceae clade the most likely root. Rearrangement was performed with edge weight (based on rapid bootstrapping) cutoff of 90%. The resulting reconciled and rearranged tree had a total of 44 duplications and 14 losses.
