script files - need to modify the path in the scripts to make them work due to the reorganizing.

| script file name | purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| cauris_Hil_rename.sh | use sed to rename the sequence/taxa names for the Cauris Hil homologs so it is easier to tell the relationships between them |
| clustalo-align.sh | submit clustalo alignment jobs |
| raxml-clustalo.sh | submit raxml tree reconstruction jobs |
| run-generax.sh | use GeneRax to reconcile the gene tree with the species tree |
