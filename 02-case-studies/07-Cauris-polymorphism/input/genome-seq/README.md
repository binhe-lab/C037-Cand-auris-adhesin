# Content
This folder contains additional genome sequences for _C. auris_ strains.

# Method
Based on the NCBI [recommendation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/doc/ftpfaq/#downloadservice), I went to the [NCBI assembly page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly), searched for _C. auris_, and then based on Muñoz _et al._ 2021 Genetics selected all the genomes except those in clade II, and clicked "Download assemblies" on top of the search result page. I didn't include Clade II strains because the Muñoz paper has shown that they don't have the homolog of XP_028889033. Except for B11221, all other _C. auris_ genomes at the time of this writing are "GenBank" assemblies. Most of them don't have annotations yet. So I just downloaded the "genomic fasta (.fna)" files. The downloaded files are extracted and gzipped for storage.
