| XP_028889033_features.jalview | Jalview feature file for XP_028889033 |
| XP_028889033_homologs_combine.fasta | linked from `blast` folder, contains 104 homologs |
| by-group | folder that contains subsets of sequences in the 8 _C. auris_ homolog groups |
| cauris-five-strains-for-gene-tree-no-outgroup.fasta | fasta for gene tree analysis without _D. hansenii_ |
| cauris-five-strains-for-gene-tree.fasta | fasta for gene tree analysis with _D. hansenii_ sequences |
| cauris-five-strains-homologs.fasta | fasta for just the _C. auris_ five strains homologs |
| cauris-five-strains-renamed.fasta | identical to gene-tree.fasta except that the sequence names were reformatted |
| cauris-four-strains-xxx | same as above with the clade I strain 6684 removed |
| cauris-four-strains-...epa... | for use with the EPA algorithm, with the _C. auris_ genes renamed to include the Hil1-8 name |
| gc.prt | genetic code used for tblastn, from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/misc/data/gc.prt |
| genome-seq | download the genome sequence for additional _C. auris_ strains for blast |
