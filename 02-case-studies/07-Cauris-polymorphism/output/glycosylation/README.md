From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation):

- N-linked glycans attached to a nitrogen of **asparagine** or arginine side-chains. N-linked glycosylation requires participation of a special lipid called dolichol phosphate.
- O-linked glycans attached to the hydroxyl oxygen of **serine, threonine, tyrosine**, hydroxylysine, or hydroxyproline side-chains, or to oxygens on lipids such as ceramide.

In adhesins, both types of glycosylations exist. In the Hil family, O-linked glycosylation on Ser/Thr residues appear to be the dominant type. Here we use two computational tools to predict both types in the B8441 Hil homologs.
