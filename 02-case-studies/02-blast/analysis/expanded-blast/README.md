This analysis is in response to reviewer 1's questions:

1. The submitted version used _C. auris_ Hil1's PF11765 domain as the query (bait). What if other homologs were used? Would the number and identity of the blast results change?
1. Why remove species from the blast output?

To address the first problem, I did blastp with two additional queries: the PF11765 domains in _C. albicans_ Hyr1 and _C. glabrata_ Hyr1.

As for the second question, my response and solutions are to include any species that were among the Y1000 tree in Shen et al. 2018. The more complete set can be used for the family expansion analysis. I plan to keep the homologs analysis restricted to the 104 homologs, as adding more species are not expected to change the main conclusions.
