## Introduction
This analysis is inspired by a discussion at the poster session during the 2021 Candida and Candidiasis meeting. One of the questions that come up was whethere there are intra-species variation especially in the C-terminal repetitive region of the protein homologs in _C. auris_. Given that our initial analysis in the case study was based almost exclusively on one strain, B11221 from clade III, it has been on our mind to look into any variation in copy number, domain architecture and other sequence features in other _C. auris_ strains. While there are now 80 (and counting) complete genomes [available](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/organism/498019/latest/), we chose to focus on the four strains that each represent one of the four clades in the Muñoz et al 2018 paper, i.e. B8441 (I), B11220 (II), B11221 (III), B11243 (IV).

A number of findings have already been presented in the Muñoz et al 2021 Genetics paper. Here we first summarize their findings:

1. There are 3-8 members of this protein family in the surveyed _C. auris_ strains. In particular, clade II strains have all lost 5/8 of the members, while the majority of the strains in the other three clades have all 8 (although our reference strain B11221 represents a discrepency between our analysis and theirs, where we only idnetified 7 and they claimed all 8 are present).
1. All 8 members share the N-terminal Signal Peptide followed by the PF11765 domain, while differing substantially in the sequence makeup of the remaining of the protein. Six of the eight members have intergenic tandem repeats.
1. A genome-wide scan for signatures of accelerated evolution (dN/dS) in each of the four representative strains identified among other genes members of this family, including the _RBR3, HYR3, IFF6_ (gene names based on similarity to _C. albicans_ genes).

The questions we will further pursue in this analysis are:

1. Variability in the tandem repeat copy number.
1. Variability in the TANGO predicted Beta-aggregation sequences.
1. TBD
