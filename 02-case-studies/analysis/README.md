### 2020-06-26 [HB] Lindsey's protein alignment and gene tree

_Goal_

- Write a script to automatically extract the first N bp, align and build a gene tree with RAxML.
- Use Notung to reconcile the tree.

_Approach_

1. Edit the alignment to make the gene names compatible with Notung's postfix format, i.e. geneName_speciesName.
1.
