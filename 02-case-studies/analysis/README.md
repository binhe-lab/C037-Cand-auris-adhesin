This README serves the dual purpose of documenting any analyses in this folder and also as the general notes for any analyses done, including ones with files in other folders.

## Contents

| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- |
| blast.Rmd | BLAST to identify homologs for case gene | symbolic link points to `output/blast/` folder | HB/2020 |

## Notes
Notes about specific analyses are often stored in the README files in their respective folder, e.g. `output/gene-tree/`
Here I store notes and ideas not easily classified under any output folder.
