## How does protein aggregate?
- "the aggregation process is generally initiated from partially or completely unfolded forms of the peptides and proteins associated with each disease" [1]
- a study of the α/β protein acylphosphatase (AcP) showed that [2]
    - "All the mutations that significantly perturb the rate of aggregation are located in two regions of the protein sequence, ...... each of which has a relatively high hydrophobicity and propensity to form β-sheet structure"
    - "the kinetic partitioning between aggregation and folding can be attributed to the intrinsic conformational preferences of the denatured polypeptide chain"
    - mutations that affect (increase) the protein aggregation rate are in two regions that are relatively unstructured in the "transition state", which corresponds to an early stage of the folding of the protein, while mutations in a region with similarly high hydrophobicity and formation of beta-structures, but is structured in the transition state, have large effects on the rate of folding but little consequence on that of aggregation.
## What is beta-aggregation and what is amyloid?
- What is "beta-sheet" or beta-structure

    "Beta sheets consist of beta strands (also β-strand) connected laterally by at least two or three backbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A β-strand is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids long with backbone in an extended conformation." [3]

- "Amyloids are aggregates of proteins characterised by a fibrillar morphology of 7–13 nm in diameter, a β-sheet secondary structure (known as cross-β) and ability to be stained by particular dyes, such as Congo red." [4]

- Difference between beta-aggregation and amyloid [5]
    - "Under physiological conditions, almost any protein can be induced at high concentration to form amorphous aggregates; under the same conditions, a much smaller set of proteins form highly ordered beta-rich amyloid fibers.
    - "although aggregation and amyloidosis correlate to a certain extent, they are different processes and should be treated as such"
    - "almost any residue can be accommodated at any position of an hexapeptide for beta-aggregation to occur, as long as the sequence as a whole has a good propensity to be in a beta-extended conformation, and is sufficiently hydrophobic and/or neutral in charge"
    - beta-aggregation often co-occurs with amyloid formation. when this happens, the former is frequently observed as a precursor of the latter. however, not all amyloids are enriched in beta-structures.
