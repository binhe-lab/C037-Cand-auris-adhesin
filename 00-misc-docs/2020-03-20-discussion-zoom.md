# global comparisons
1. CATH
1. Orthogroup, sequence alignment, blastp values, tree, to see intuitively how closely related the sequences are
1. Tandem repeats
    a. parse results from XSTREAM
    b. only tandem repeats
1. _C. glabrata_ new genome, figure out the GPI-anchored protein sequences in the supplementary
1. In _S. cerevisiae_, flocculation genes are known to contain high amounts of repeats, which, depending on the amino acid composition, may increase hydrophobicity and thus contribute to adhesion?
1. find reciprocol best hits between the three _C. auris_ adhesin lists to reduce them into one "pan-adhesinome" in _C. auris_
    a. perhaps run CD-HIT or OrthoMCL locally to get the all-against-all blastp scores, and filter out "perfect" pairs that represent straight orthologs.
    b. the idea is to assemble a more complete adhesinome regardless of which genome they come from, and whether 

# case studies
## Structure
1. I-Tasser
   a. hit with bacterial adhesin, structure linked to function
1. Gene tree
   a. Rachel took 12 single-copy genes and concatenated and aligned them to build a consensus species tree
   b. look into re-arrangement

# Future to do
1. Expression pattern; Co-expressed adhesins?
1. Co-localized (physically clustered) adhesins?
1. From the global comparison, identify potential factors, like aggregation potential or tandem repeats, and then go back to the _C. auris_ genome to fish out new candidates.
