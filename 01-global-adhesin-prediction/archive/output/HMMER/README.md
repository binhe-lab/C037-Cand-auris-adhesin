[hmmscan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/search/hmmscan) against pfam database using "gathering" threshold. Sequences were split into two files so that each had less than 500 sequences. The two job numbers were E496B790-532F-11EA-9760-9253E976C163 and 0852DDA2-5705-11EA-BF27-3F9153F04F9B. The html output batch summary tables were copied and combined into one text file and used to retreive each individual result. Results are available in a .zip and folders for each species.
