Calculate cysteine frequencis and dibasic peptide (RR/KK/KR/RK) frequencies in predicted adhesins.
see `script/amino-acid-composition` for details
Additional results are symbolically linked the `analysis/amino-acid-composition` folder, where I parsed all the protein sequences through the counting procedure, in order to compare between adhesins and the rest of the genome.
