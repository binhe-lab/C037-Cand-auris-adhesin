TANGO output files for the *C. auris* proteomes. Note that the initial commit contained files run by Rachel under the Windows environment. However, the results contained a number of calculation errors that are concerning. Later Bin reran all tango predictions on the ARGON linux cluster using the x86_64 version of the tango program (v2.3). The results in this folder were replaced by the newly generated output.
