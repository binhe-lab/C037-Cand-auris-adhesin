alignment and dotplot between PIS58185 and XP_028889033 was performed by [COBOLT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/cobalt.cgi) (first did blastp 2-seq, which had a "Multiple Alignment" link that generated a COBALT alignment). I'm sure a clustalo alignment would have achieved a similar result.

in addition to PIS58185, I also did a similar analysis for QEL63124.1, which is a non-Hil protein but has almost identical sequences as the central repetitive region of Hil1 (without the NTD and serine-rich region).
