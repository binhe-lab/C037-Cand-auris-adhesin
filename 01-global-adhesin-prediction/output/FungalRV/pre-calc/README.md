1. Additional file 2:Adhesins and adhesin like proteins predicted by FungalRV adhesin Predictor in 8 human fungal pathogens. The file lists 307 adhesins and adhesin like proteins obtained by "FungalRV adhesin predictor" run on entire proteomes of eight human pathogenic fungal species along with their FungalRV adhesin predictor scores. Known adhesins are coloured in Green. (XLS 100 KB)
