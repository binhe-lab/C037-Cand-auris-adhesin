The goal of this analysis is to run two fungal adhesion predictors, [FungalRV](http://fungalrv.igib.res.in/) and [FaaPred](http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/faap/) on the proteome of _C. auris_ strains and rank candidate genes based on the overlap of the two tools' predictions. After that, we would like to draw a genome-wide comparison of the "adhesinome" of _C. auris_ vs _C. albicans_, in terms of known classes of adhesins and properties such as presence of a well-folded N-terminal domain and GPI anchors.
