# Questions

Are there other genes in the _C. auris_ genome that share the sequence properties of the Hil family? If so, they could be potential adhesins.

# Background

We originally wanted to compare the adhesin genes in diverse species of yeasts to determine if the number, sequence features and other properties are similar or distinct among the adhesin genes in different species, whether they were ancestral and inherited, or were many of them species specific, suggesting that they evolved de novo. The attempt is documented in the `archive` folder. The basis of that analysis was the predicted adhesins in a number of yeast species. However, we realized that the fungal adhesin predictors are far from being able to accurately predict the adhesins and not including false positives. Analysis built on top of the prediction results would then be highly unreliable. We thus focused most of our energy on the case study of the Hyr/Iff-like (Hil) family proteins. After detailed analyses of that family, we started to wonder if **there are more proteins that are like the Hil proteins** in the _C. auris_ proteome, hence the current analysis.
